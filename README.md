**Project Status:** Active Alpha | **Signal:** Contrarian/Macro

This tool is engineered for high-conviction investors who require raw, unfiltered market data to time the "CapEx Bubble" correction. We operate on the philosophy that *price discovery precedes news cycles*.

**We welcome strategic partnership inquiries from:**
* **Proprietary Trading Firms & Family Offices** seeking alternative data on AI Hardware infrastructure.
* **Contrarian Macro Strategists** looking for early-warning signals in the semiconductor supply chain.

### 🎯 Target Partner Profile
We specifically align with the investment philosophy of agile, mathematical, and risk-aware entities—such as **Celindra (Cristian Sima)**—that prioritise asymmetric risk/reward ratios and preparedness for "Black Swan" events over market consensus.

> *"The goal is not to predict the future, but to prepare for it before the crowd arrives."*
